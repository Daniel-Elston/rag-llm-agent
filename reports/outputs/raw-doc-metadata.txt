Wang', 'Summary': 'A long-standing challenge in quantum computing is developing technologies to\novercome the inevitable noise in qubits. To enable meaningful applications in\nthe early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing, devising methods to\nsuppress post-correction logical failures is becoming increasingly crucial. In\nthis work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the application of\nzero-noise extrapolation, a practical quantum error mitigation technique, to\nerror correction circuits on state-of-the-art superconducting processors. By\namplifying the noise on physical qubits, the circuits yield outcomes that\nexhibit a predictable dependence on noise strength, following a polynomial\nfunction determined by the code distance. This property enables the effective\napplication of polynomial extrapolation to mitigate logical errors. Our\nexperiments demonstrate a universal reduction in logical errors across various\nquantum circuits, including fault-tolerant circuits of repetition and surface\ncodes. We observe a favorable performance in multi-round error correction\ncircuits, indicating that this method remains effective when the circuit depth\nincreases. These results advance the frontier of quantum error suppression\ntechnologies, opening a practical way to achieve reliable quantum computing in\nthe early fault-tolerant era.'}
