. To enable meaningful applications in the early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing, devising methods to suppress post-correction logical failures is becoming in- creasingly crucial. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the application of zero-noise extrapolation, a practical quantum error mitigation technique, to error correction circuits on state-of-the-art superconducting processors. By amplifying the noise on physical qubits, the cir- cuits yield outcomes that exhibit a predictable dependence on noise strength, following a polynomial function determined by the code distance. This property enables the effective application of poly- nomial extrapolation to mitigate logical errors. Our experiments demonstrate a universal reduction in logical errors across various quantum circuits, including fault-tolerant circuits of repetition and surface codes. We observe a favorable performance in multi-round error correction circuits, indi- cating that this method remains effective when the circuit depth increases

. These results advance the frontier of quantum error suppression technologies, opening a practical way to achieve reliable quantum computing in the early fault-tolerant era. I. INTRODUCTION Suppressingerrorsisaproblemthatliesatthecenterof quantum computing technologies. Quantum error correc- tion and mitigation are the two generic methods of error suppression. Error correction promises to reach an ar- bitrarily high fidelity provided sufficient qubit resources. Recently, experiments have demonstrated a positive gain in the surface code error correction when scaling the code distance up to 7 [1]. However, it is still viewed as a long-term goal to achieve negligible infidelity through er- ror correction, which could need millions or even more qubits and pose a challenge to the experimental tech- nologies regarding scalability [2]. Error mitigation takes different resources, computing time, to suppress errors, being originally designed for the regime that error cor- rection is lacking [3]. Considering the earliest applica- tions of quantum computing, it is highly likely that they will be carried out under strict technology constraints, mainly on the qubit number

. To overcome this issue, we adopt a strategy of amplifying noise on physical qubits instead of logical qubits. By integrating error mitigation tech- niques with error correction, this study demonstrates a practical pathway to bridge the gap between the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and the fault- tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era, advancing the pursuit of practical quantum computing technologies. II. RESULTS We shall first justify the application of ZNE to quan- tum error correction circuits. The essential assumption made in ZNE is that the expected value of an observ- able is a function ⟨O⟩(r) of the noise strength r, and this function can be fitted well by simple functions such as polynomials. This assumption holds in NISQ circuits, which has been illustrated in many theoretical works and experiments [3, 6, 7, 12, 23–25]. In this paper, one of the primary goals is to demonstrate that the assumption is also valid in quantum error correction circuits
